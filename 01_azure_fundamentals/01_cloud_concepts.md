## 📘 Module Notes

### 1️⃣ Describe Cloud Computing
- **Definition**: Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet (“the cloud”).
- **Cloud Models**:  
  - **Public** – Services delivered over the public internet by providers (Azure, AWS).  
  - **Private** – Dedicated environment, hosted on-premises or in a private cloud.  
  - **Hybrid** – Combination of public + private cloud for flexibility.
- **Consumption-Based Model**: Pay only for resources you use.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**:  
  - **Provider** – Security *of* the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, software platform).  
  - **Customer** – Security *in* the cloud (data, access control, configurations).

---

### 2️⃣ Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **High Availability** – Services accessible whenever needed.
- **Scalability** – Increase resources to meet demand.
- **Elasticity** – Scale in/out dynamically based on demand.
- **Reliability** – Built-in redundancy and failover.
- **Predictability** – Performance and cost consistency.
- **Security & Governance** – Built-in security tools, compliance frameworks.
- **Manageability** – Automated deployments, monitoring, updates.

### 3️⃣ Cloud Service Types
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Virtual machines, storage, networks; user manages OS, apps, configs.  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Environment for app development & deployment without managing underlying infrastructure.  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Fully managed software delivered over the internet (e.g., Microsoft 365).  

**Use Cases**:  
- **IaaS**: Lift-and-shift migrations, testing environments.  
- **PaaS**: Custom application development.  
- **SaaS**: Email, productivity tools.

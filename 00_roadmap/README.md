# ðŸ—º Cloud Solutions Architect Roadmap

This roadmap is based on the official **Cloud Solutions Architect Pathway** (AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-500, AZ-305) from Microsoft Learn.

In addition to the certification pathway, it includes **supplementary skills** (Linux, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, etc.) that are not part of the formal pathway but are **essential for real-world architecture work**.

---

## **Why Include Skills Beyond the Pathway?**
- The certification pathway builds a strong Azure foundation.
- Real-world architects also work with Linux, DevOps pipelines, IaC tools, scripting, and cost/security optimization.
- These additional skills make this roadmap more **comprehensive and job-ready**.
